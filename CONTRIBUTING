Hi!
To contribute to the development of the chatbot, the following steps must be followed:

1. Install RASA Framework https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/installation/
2. Install Spacy https://spacy.io/usage and download ro_core: "python -m spacy download ro_core_news_md"
or en_core: "python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm"
3. Get database private key (https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/acs-upb-mobile-dev)
4. Put the key in the root directory (which contains intents, src, srcEN.. directories)
5. Choose the chatbot you want to train (english or romanian )
6. Train a model: rasa train (first you need to enter the src directory specific to the chatbot)
7. Run the model: rasa run
8. Run custom actions: rasa run actions
9. Add your contribution
10. Make sure you don't put the key on github project (ex: git status)
11. Check step 10 again (:D)
