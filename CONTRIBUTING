Hi!
To contribute to the development of the chatbot, the following steps must be followed:

2. Install Spacy https://spacy.io/usage and download ro_core: "python -m spacy download ro_core_news_md"
or en_core: "python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm"
1. Get database private key (https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/acs-upb-mobile-dev)
2. Put the key in the root directory (which contains intents, src, srcEN.. directories)
3. Choose the chatbot you want to train (english or romanian )
