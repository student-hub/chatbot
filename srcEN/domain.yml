            The transfer from CTI to IS can be done through an application submitted at the beginning of the first semester to the secretariat.
            The transfer from IS to CTI can be done by contacting the secretariat and registering for admission.
            The transfer conditions are:
            - Getting a better admission grade than the last student admitted to the CTI
            - Total credits to exceed the threshold of the year.
            **Important**
            Identical subjects between specializations may be equivalent (including SD equivalent to SDA, or vice versa), but the different ones must be made and paid for (as a backlog, but which has no effect on accommodation at a dormitory).
            Consequently, the credits for the materials to be recovered must be obtained and replace the two different subjects from the old contract (Logical Design and Numerical Methods for CTI).
            Transfers must be approved by the dean's office, but if a transfer is not accepted, the candidate will not lose his / her place.
            **The procedure is subject to change, so feel free to contact the secretariat or dean's office for more details.**.
