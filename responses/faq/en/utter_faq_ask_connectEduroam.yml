        The connection in the eduroam network is made on the basis of the same account used on the course site.
         For the eduroam network the identification data will be of the form:
         eduroam user: <course-user> @ pub.ro
         password: <course-p>
         Before logging in to the eduroam network, your login data needs to be synchronized with the authentication server.
         This can be done by changing the password within the course site.
         You can make two password changes to return to the original password.
